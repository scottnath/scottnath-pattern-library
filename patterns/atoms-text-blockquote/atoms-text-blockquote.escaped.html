&lt;blockquote class=&quot;base__blockquote&quot; cite=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote&quot;&gt;The HTML &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt; element.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
